# Bidirectional Search
- Within the code we have an Implementation of Bidirectional search for the final project in CS 2400 
- The bidirectional search algorithm is contained within the UninformedSearch class
- The puzzle sliding game logic is within the Problem class (as a subclass)
- First select the algorithm you would like to use. 
- Then select if you would like to try the sliding puzzle or mazes 
- You can change the size of the sliding puzzle by changing the variable SIZE in the run_puzzle() method in the main 
- For example, making SIZE = 3 will make a 3x3 sliding puzzle. 
- The hardest possible state to fix the sliding puzzle is used when trying to solve the game
- ***The puzzle sliding game can only be run with one algorithm at a time, if you try to run it with
multiple algorithms it will not work correctly***
